 * Easy (44.59%)
 * Total Accepted:    29874
 * Total Submissions: 67016
 * Testcase Example:  '"abccccdd"'
 *
 * Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the
 * length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.
 * 
 * This is case sensitive, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome
 * here.
 * 
 * Note:
 * Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.
 * 
 * 
 * Example: 
 * 
 * Input:
 * "abccccdd"
 * 
 * Output:
 * 7
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
