 *
 * Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
 * 
 * Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
 * 
 * All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while
 * preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same
 * character but a character may map to itself.
 * 
 * For example,
 * Given "egg", "add", return true.
 * 
 * Given "foo", "bar", return false.
 * 
 * Given "paper", "title", return true.
 * 
 * Note:
 * You may assume both s and t have the same length.
