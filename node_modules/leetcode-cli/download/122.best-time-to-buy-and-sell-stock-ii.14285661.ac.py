# Testcase Example:  '[]'
#
# Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock
# on day i.
# 
# Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many
# transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock
# multiple times). However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the
# same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        if len(prices) == 0: return 0
        l=h=prices[0]
        x = 0
        for p in prices:
            if p < l : l = p
            diff = p - l
            if diff > 0:
                x += diff
                l = p
        return x
