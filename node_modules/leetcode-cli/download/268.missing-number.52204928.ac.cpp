 * Total Submissions: 221548
 * Testcase Example:  '[0]'
 *
 * 
 * Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n,
 * find the one that is missing from the array.
 * 
 * 
 * For example,
 * Given nums = [0, 1, 3] return 2.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement
 * it using only constant extra space complexity?
 * 
 * 
 * Credits:Special thanks to @jianchao.li.fighter for adding this problem and
 * creating all test cases.
