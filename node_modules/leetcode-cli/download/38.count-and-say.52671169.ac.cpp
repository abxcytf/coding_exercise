 * The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:
 * 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
 * 11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
 * 21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Given an integer n, generate the nth sequence.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note: The sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
