# Testcase Example:  '[1,1]'
#
# Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point
# at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints
# of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with
# x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
# 
# Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

    # @return an integer
