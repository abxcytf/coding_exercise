# Testcase Example:  '[]'
#
# Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock
# on day i.
# 
# Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two
# transactions.
# 
# Note:
# You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must
# sell the stock before you buy again).

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        x = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            v = self.find(prices[0:i]) + self.find(prices[i:])
            if v > x: x = v
        return x
    def find(self,prices):
        if len(prices) == 0: return 0
        l=h=prices[0]
        x = 0
        for p in prices:
            if p < l : l = p
            diff = p - l
            if diff > x: x = diff
        return x
