# Follow up for "Unique Paths":
# 
# Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths
# would there be?
# 
# An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
# 
# For example,
# There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.
# 
# [
# [0,0,0],
# [0,1,0],
# [0,0,0]
# ]
# 
# The total number of unique paths is 2.
# 
# Note: m and n will be at most 100.
#
class Solution:
    # @return an integer
