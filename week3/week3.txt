####################  Week3 Notes #################
HW1: Sort Frequency
Testcases:
"tree"
""
"1b2b3n3m4n5b6b6hj6j"
Output:
Accepted on first shot.


HW3: Number of Islands I
Very basic BFS
Note:  Need to tell if the cell content is 1/0 or '1'/'0'. Need any test case to figure that out.
TestCases:
Randomized checking, see source code.
Output:
Accepted after 1 modifications.

HW4: Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node 
Very basic level-order traversal
Note: forget to add null pointer checks when pushing the nodes to the queue. Caught on any basic test cases.
Output:
Accepcted after 1 modification.

HW5: Populatingg Next Right Pointers in Each Node II
Same as HW4
Output:
Direct copy of code after judgement that it will also work. Accepted on first shot.

HW6: Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal
Level Order Traversal + List Operations.
TestCases:
[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
[1,2]
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output:
Accepted on first shot.
Note:
DFS is also easy as is here:

HW7: Sort List
Merge sort on list
Note: Spent much debugging time because I forgot to update left and right when dividing to sub problems.
Testcases:
[]
[1]
[2,1]
[3,2,4,1,5,6,9,7]
[3,2,4,1,5]
I have also done random testing to ensure correctness.
Output:
Accepted on first shot (after local testing)
